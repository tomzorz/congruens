Interview me in detail using the Question Tool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file. During this process keep saving progress and information into temporary markdown files, that can be used when context is compressed / refreshed to continue.
